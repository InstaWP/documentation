# Viewing Logs

A typical InstaWP site has two type of logs - Access Logs and Error Logs. To view logs follow the steps outlined.

- __Error Logs__ allows you to see the PHP/Apache related error logs for the site. 
- __Access Logs__ shows you the live hits to your website with IP address, URL, HTTP status code etc. 

** Open Logs **

To view logs for a site, click on the "View Logs" icons, as shown below:
