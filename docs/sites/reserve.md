|Free Plan   |48 hours|
|Personal Plan   |7 days   |
|Professional Plan   |7 days   |
|Agency Plan   |15 days   |
|Enterprise Plan   |Customize  |

### Site Deletion

When a site is expired, we put it in a "expired" state and do not delete it right away. We provide you a 7 day period to "restore" a site before its completely wiped off from our servers. 

To restore a site click on "Restore".

Free accounts have a restore limit of 3 times per month, resetting every month end. Upgrade your plan to increase this limit.

### Reserving a Site

You can mark a site as reserved so that it does not expire and it stays in your account forever (unless manually deleted or marked as un-reserved). 

To reserve a site, there are two ways. 

**1. Reserve in the new site dialog**

**2. Reserve after a site is created**
