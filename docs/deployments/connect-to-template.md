# Templates + Git Integration

After you have completed [adding a deployment](/docs/deployments/add-deployment), you can connect it to an existing template. The logic behind this step is this - a template is a snapshot of a site or a point in time backup. 

Once a deployment is connected to a template, every time you have a new change in your Git branch you can create a new site off of the template and we will automatically pull the latest changes to your Git repo onto the new site. 

### Connecting a Deployment with Template

Go to Templates screen, and click on the Deployment button to connect it to a deployment.

You will then see a modal popup with a list of connected Deployments, choose the correct one.

Once this is complete, you can save and close the modal box.
